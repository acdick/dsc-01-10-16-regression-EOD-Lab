    "\n",
    "In this lab, we shall apply regression analysis and diagnostics techniques covered in this section to a familiar \"Boston Housing\" dataset. We are going to identify the predictive ability of features found in this dataset towards identifying housing prices. \n",

    "### Objectives:\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Perform statistical tests on our data\n",
    "* Build linear models with boston housing data set using OLS\n",
    "* Visually explain the results and interpret the diagnostics from Statsmodels \n",
    "* Comment on the goodness of fit for a simple regression model"
